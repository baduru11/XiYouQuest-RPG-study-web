## Executive Overview

### What is the PSC?

The **Putonghua Proficiency Test** (普通話水平測試, abbreviated as **PSC** or **Putonghua Shuiping Ceshi**) is the **official standardized oral proficiency examination for Standard Mandarin Chinese (Putonghua)** designed specifically for **native speakers of Chinese** or people from regions where Chinese dialects are spoken.

- **Vocabulary and grammar correctness** (词汇、语法规范 - vocabulary and grammar norms)
- **Accent reduction** (方音影响 - dialectal accent influence)

### Key Characteristics

- **Oral/Spoken Format Only**: Not a written test
- **Native Speaker Focus**: Primarily for native Chinese speakers (not for second-language learners; HSK serves that purpose)
- **Standardized System**: National standard with official certification
- **Professional Certification**: Certificate required for specific professions
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Combines human examiners with digital recording
- **Authority**: National Language and Writing Work Committee (国家语言文字工作委员会)

- **Scores compared** for consistency
- **Average taken** if scores within acceptable range
- **Recount/review** if scores diverge significantly

#### Moderation Standards

- **National Consistency**: All test centers follow national evaluation standards
- **Annual Calibration**: Examiners recertified annually
- **Sample Audits**: Random recordings reviewed nationally for quality assurance
- **Appeal Process**: Candidates can request rescoring if believed unfair

## CRITICAL INSIGHTS FOR AI SYSTEMS

### Key Metrics for Understanding PSC Difficulty

1. **Tone Accuracy**: Single most important factor (affects 50%+ of scoring)
2. **Dialect Elimination**: Must sound like Beijing/Northern Mandarin (affects 40%+ of scoring)
3. **Fluency Over Perfection**: Smooth speech valued more than perfect word-by-word accuracy
4. **Time Management**: Component 5 (speech) requires 3+ minutes; shorter = automatic deduction
5. **Vocabulary Range**: Not tested for breadth, but for appropriateness and standardness
6. **Grammar Consistency**: Matters more in selection components and speech than in reading

### Score Prediction Indicators

**Likely 1A/1B Candidate** (92+):
- No perceptible dialect
- Perfect/near-perfect tone accuracy
- Fluent, natural speech patterns
- Professional or near-professional background
- Likely from Beijing or Mandarin-standard region

**Likely 2A/2B Candidate** (80-91):
- Minimal dialectal accent
- 80-95% tone accuracy
- Good fluency with occasional hesitation
- Professional training or education background
- May have regional accent but controlled

**Likely 3A/3B Candidate** (60-79):
- Noticeable dialectal accent
- 70-85% tone accuracy
- Speech comprehensible but with effort
- Limited professional training
- Strong regional influence

**Likely Failing Candidate** (<60):
- Heavy dialectal accent
- <70% tone accuracy
- Poor fluency and many hesitations
- No Mandarin training
- Speech difficult to understand

### Regional Performance Patterns

**Highest Average Scores**:
- Beijing and Northern China (native Mandarin regions)
- Overseas test-takers in Singapore/international locations
- Professional broadcasters and teachers

**Lowest Average Scores**:
- Cantonese-speaking regions (Hong Kong, Guangdong)
- Fujian/Min-speaking regions
- Sichuan/Southwestern dialect regions
- First-time test-takers without training

### Training Priorities for Non-Native Level Speakers

**Most Impactful** (invest most time):
1. Eliminate 儿化音 errors (erhua pronunciation)
2. Master tone sandhi rules (especially 3rd tone, 不 tone changes)
3. Reduce dialectal accent through phonetics training
4. Build fluency in spontaneous speech (Component 5)

**High Impact** (invest medium time):
5. Improve tone accuracy overall
6. Learn measure word system (Component 3B)
7. Develop natural intonation patterns
8. Practice 3+ minute continuous speech

**Medium Impact** (invest less time):
9. Memorize vocabulary differences from dialect
10. Study grammar patterns (Component 3C)
11. Learn grammatical structures for written passages
