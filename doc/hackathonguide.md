Dear Students,  

Are you ready to revolutionize language learning with AI?  

The Center for Language Education and Department of Computer Science and Engineering proudly invite all HKUST UG & PG students to participate in the GenAI Hackathon: Competition on a Putonghua Web Tool 普通話學習編程比賽.  

  

The Challenge: 
Your mission is to design and build an innovative GenAI web tool to help students conquer the Putonghua Proficiency Test (PSC).  

To build the best tool, you need to understand the PSC test:  

·                     The Putonghua Proficiency Test (PSC) is the national standard test for Putonghua proficiency . 

·                     It is a 100% oral exam, assessed live by nationally certified examiners . 

·                     There are five sections in the test, adding up to a total score pegged to the “six grades in three levels” scale . 

Your solution should empower students to practice their skills and knowledge, to receive AI-driven feedback, and to master the contents of the official test effectively.
