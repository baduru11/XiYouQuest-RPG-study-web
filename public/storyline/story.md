Overall Storyline / Synopsis 

 

Stage 1 (Prologue) 

Long ago, sacred scriptures brought from the West stabilized the world through the power of language. However, over centuries, people have grown careless about their language, by misusing the tone, as well as having weakened pronunciation.  

From the broken sounds, monsters were born. The source of corruption comes from the West, where an unknown shadow figure disrupts the language.  

You, as the main character, are an ordinary traveler that has a desire and a vow to defeat the figure that causes chaos, and you kick start the Journey to the West.  

As soon as you start your journey, you encounter a powerful entity: The Demon King of Turmoil. You could not parry their attack. They are more powerful than you are. Your voice trembles, and your syllables lack strength. You lose the fight by a mile.  

As you fall to your knees, the sky opens wide. A divine staff descends, an echo of ancient legends. It was once used by an all-knowing, powerful, and agile hero, Sun Wukong. As soon as you try to wield the power sleeping in the staff, a celestial voice from the sky speaks in a deep voice: “Clarity is strength. Speak correctly, and the world will answer.” The divine staff glows in golden light as it binds to you. It can only be wielded when you correctly pronounce the Chinese characters.  

The celestial being has given you one more item: a map of the Western Palace. You rise again, feeling much more capable and energetic. You seal the Demon King of Turmoil by speaking in clarity and begin your journey to the West to defeat the entity that corrupted the sounds.  

 

Stage 2 (River of Shattered Tone) 

As you walk through the road to the Western Palace, you come upon an enormous river shifting and swirling all beings coming its way, barring your path. The air is thick, due to the scent of rain and the splashing river. You see an entity inside the river, lurking and attacking whoever dares to cross the violent water. These water spirits distort and bend your pitch and stability of your voice, weakening your will to fight back. There, you see a small-sized woman that was drowning in front of your own eyes. She was fighting herself to get out of the violent river, pulling her down deep into the water.  

For each incorrect answer, these water spirits attack you by casting a spell on you, and you feel like you are drowning in your own echo. However, with every truth spoken, their evil soul weakens, calming down the river. You pull her up from the calm river. She introduces herself as Samjang, a Buddhist monk that is destined to travel to the West. You are enlightened. You talk with her in an excited mood, saying that you as well were traveling to the West. She will now accompany you to the Journey of the West. 

By wielding the divine staff and with your knowledge, you defeat the monsters blocking your path, saving your companion, and walking on the crumbling stone bridge to the next journey.  

 

Stage 3 (Desert of Illusion) 

The air becomes thicker as you walk over the bridge. You see a bright golden landscape at the far corner of your eyes. Looking at the map, the celestial being has given you, you realize that you are now in the Desert of Illusion. You have walked a long way. You feel like the Sun is drying your throat, and you wish you could drink at least one droplet of water. You feel lousy and fatigued. Then, you suddenly feel immense pressure lying on your shoulder. However, you see nothing, but a wasteland filled with weapons of a fallen adventurer. You abruptly sense that you are not alone in this desert. In a desolate wasteland, a pale bone demon that calls herself the “Lady of Bleached Bones” appears.  

She disguises herself with misleading voices. For each mispronunciation, she attacks you with her bone shards that pierce through your clothes and your flesh. Her intricate and sterile shards deal lots of damage. However, your perfect pronunciation of the word breaks her illusion, allowing you to deal critical damage to the demon, eventually defeating her at last. Before she vanishes into thin air, she warns you: “the West will consume all sounds.”  

After defeating the demon, you see another man crouching beside her, paled and scared. You walk up to him, asking if he’s alright. He thanks you for saving him just in time. He introduces himself as She Wujing, a sorcerer who uses water to defeat enemies, but vanished from heaven for breaking a priceless vase. With desperation in need of water, you ask him if he could create a source of water for him to drink as you are about to fall on your knees. Wujing gladly accepts your request, saying that he is enlightened to help his savior. You and your other two companions introduce themselves to each other and go on the way to the West Palace, to defeat evil.  

 

 

Stage 4 (Moonlit Mountain)  

As you walk your way through the desert, the night falls upon the landscape. You are unsure of how long you have been traveling through the desert. The air starts to feel less heavy, and you finally can breathe with ease. You are met with yet another gigantic landscape, but this time it is a mountain. The night consumed the mountain, but the moon in the sky lights your path as you walk through as if it is guiding you through your journey. Suddenly, an eerie howl is heard deep in the mountains. The wind rustles, hiding an unknown monster lurking in the woods. You wield the divine staff and use it as a source of light. An entity rushes towards you: a Moonfang Wolf Demon. The wolf has a clear eye like a moon in the sky, as if this wolf knows everything about the traveler.  

You wield your divine staff at the demon wolf, parrying the questions that are thrown at you, and fighting for the victory. The fight between you and the demon echoes across the moonlit mountain. For each incorrect answer, the wolf scratches you with its sharp nails. For each correct answer, the staff pierces through the skin of the wolf, eventually making the wolf retreat to its hiding site.  

 

Stage 5 (Misty Bamboo Forest) 

You as the traveler start to gain more knowledge, enough to wield divine powers from the staff the celestial being has given you. You trek down to the ground level from high up the mountains and enter another territory where everything is foggy. There are bamboo sticks going high up in the sky, making it difficult to see the end of it. This eerie background makes the traveler anticipate what will be the demonic entity that they will fight this time.  

Suddenly, you hear a loud rumble coming deep from the ground, and it is coming closer to you. Looking in the direction of the sound, you see a demonic entity with red eyes and brown skin: an entity that is feared by everyone in the vicinity. It is the Bull Demon King. He was once powerful but now corrupted by the distorted sound of the West. It rushes towards you as you deploy your staff and throws words that you must pronounce correctly. 

For every incorrect answer, the bull charges you and pierces you with its horns. However, for every correct answer, the bull’s flame extinguishes into thin air, weakening its strength to duel. As you defeat and put him to the ground, he speaks in a deep voice: “You are walking on your own shadow. Halt here or face the consequences.” With the victory in your hand, you move on.  

 

 

 

Stage 6 (Plains of Fading Echoes) 

You are unsure of how many days have passed since you first started your journey to the West to defeat the demon, who has been causing chaos in the world by destroying the sacred scripture and its power. However, you are much closer to defeating the final boss than you think. You finish walking through the misty bamboo forest; the sun greets you with a golden light as if it represents your divine staff and the victory you will take. The night is over, and only the bright will guide your traveler.  

You expect to meet another powerful entity that would bar your pathway. However, you are met with none other than a vast open plain, where it seems too peaceful to be true. The sky is pale and clear, with almost no clouds that are spotted. The trees are moving gently, the birds chirping, and there are no other creatures that are seen, except a pigsy man, lying down on the plain grass, sleeping. You don’t expect any demons here. However, this was calm before the storm.  

From the sky, you see an entity floating down. It is not hostile like any other creatures you have met in the past journey. You try to wield your staff towards it even if it is not hostile. A sudden voice disturbs you from further swinging the staff. It is a deep voice that shakes your body deep down from the bottom. “You shall pass the ‘Heavenly Principles’ trial and prove yourself that you are worth more than what you look to be.” It introduces itself as one of the ‘Heavenly Guardians’ and calls itself a celestial being, coming to test the traveler to see if you are suitable and worthy for the final trial before entering the Western Palace. You deploy your divine staff and show that you are ready and capable of defeating the Heavenly Guardians.  

For each incorrect answer, the celestial being will strike you with their god-like powers. If your speech is steady, they will kneel upon you and give you their sacred and eternal strength and knowledge, more than enough to defeat the all-knowing final boss in the Western Palace.  

The celestial being looks down upon you and declares: “You have proven yourself to be capable of defeating any entity that brings harm to you. You dared to fight against me, and you now will have the pressure to win against the final boss in the Western Palace and free the voices of the fallen adventurers. May the divine staff guide your way till the end of your journey.” You bow to the celestial being as it rises to the opening of the sky.  

As you are about to leave the plain, you remember that you saw a pigsy man, lying down on the plain grass. You walk up to him, asking his name. He introduces himself as Zhu Baijie, a pigsy man who once was heavenly commander of celestial soldiers. However, he was banished due to his laziness and assault. Zhu Baijie said he could help on your journey, saying that he could provide motivational speech before him and his companion went on their way to fight the final demon that caused all this chaos. You accept him to be your companion and decide to leave this peaceful area. 

At the end of the plain, you see a distant silhouette of the Western Palace, the territory where you aimed to reach for days.  

 

Stage 7 (Finale) 

You finally stepped your foot into the Western Palace. Your first impression of the palace – it's not what you have expected. It’s eerily quiet and eccentric. As you walk in, you slowly unveil the truth behind all of these demons. The final corruption was not an ordinary king of the demons, but instead, it was a twisted shadow of Sun Wukong, an all-knowing divine entity that once ruled the world.  

This entity represents two distinct features: strength without clarity and voice without understanding. He feeds on your mispronunciation. He feeds on your fear. Every crackle in your tone strengthens him. The only way to defeat him is to gather all the knowledge that you have learned from the prologue till now to present that you are much more powerful and diligent than the twisted soul of Sun Wukong. You wield the divine staff and see a golden light awaken from its sleep. Your voice is empowered. Every pronunciation is clear and accurate. As you finally deplete the strength of the twisted soul, the divine staff that glowed in gold ascends to the sky. Once again, a celestial being speaks. However, unlike before, the celestial being has regained its original voice. It speaks in a clear tone, as if they have regained their voice after defeating the twisted soul.  

The celestial being expresses gratitude towards you, the main character, and praises you with recognition for your contribution to the world. The sacred scriptures are restored to its original state, and the world is stabilized as it should be. You as the main character now has ownership to the divine staff, and you make a vow to yourself that you will always protect and abide by the rules of Chinese pronunciation to create harmony in this world.
